# GeneticAlgorithm

### A genetic algorithm for selecting optimal feature combinations with sklearn supervised ML objects

See the docstring of GeneticAlgorithm.py for a brief explanation for how this works

### To do

- Add plotting functionality for the progression of fitness
- Test with various datasets and sklearn classifiers/regressors
- Think of a more efficient way of parallelizing - at the moment new workers are activated every time a new generation
  is trained

### Useage

- This should work with any Sklearn classifer or regression object. It can be used as in this simple example

First, make a classifier of your choice, and select hyperparameters. Note that the generic algorithm does not select
hyperparameters, only features to train on.

- RF = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1,min_samples_split=2,min_samples_leaf=1)

Make a genetic algorithm object. X and Y here are dataframes of the predictors (X) and target vector (Y).

- GA = GeneticAlgorithm(X,Y,RF,njobs=4)

Call GA.fit(). This will run the algorithm. It may take a long time!

- GA.fit()

An optimal combination of columns is selected and this can then be used in future developments. The selected features
are assigned to the variable 'GA.feature_selection'
